=========

[![Build Status](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/raphaelbauer/job/doctester/badge/icon)](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/raphaelbauer/job/doctester/)

A doctest library for Java. Heavily inspired by both the excellent pyhton's doctests 
and the marvelous devbliss.doctest libraries.

Some specs:

 * Uses hamcrest for unit testing
 * Uses Bootstrap as styling library
 * Simple - only 7 classes.
